                <p>Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales,
                    I present my credentials as a geologist,
                    by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason,
                    and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults,
                    cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary,
                    I desire to remind the reader,
                    that while in the earlier geological strata there are
                    found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct;
                    the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary
                    formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted links,

                    Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out."

                    "No one knows it but you four--and myself," replied Oz.

                <p>At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning ball teams.
                    My speed and control must both have been above the ordinary,
                    for I made such a record during my senior year at college
                    that overtures were made to me in behalf of one of the great
                    major-league teams; but in the tightest pitch that ever had
                    confronted me in the past I had never been in such need for control as now.
                    As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles
                    under absolute command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me</p>

    <p>"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.'</p>
    <p>"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'</p>
    <p>"'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.'</p>
    <h4>"Very well," answered Oz meekly.  "Come to me tomorrow and you</h4>
    <p>Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.</p>
    <p>But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  They saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then, with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.</p>
    <p>In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head, screaming.</p>
